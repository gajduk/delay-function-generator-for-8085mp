The GUI always works with 8085.
Specify the duration in the text-boxes at top.
You can put 100 in seconds you don't have to put 1 min and 40 seconds.
All must be numbers.

In the error toleration box put in how manu states error from the desired is accceptable
to you. You can use percentiles or plain numbers of states.
**You should always give some tolerance.

Don't change the state lasting box unless you know what are you doing.

In the registers&Stack panel you will find a lot of check boxes.

Check those registers that you don't care what happens to, their value may and will be changed
in the code generated.

Check the RET? box if you want a return instruction at the end of the code.
(if you are making a function that will be called from your main routine).

Explanation for the stack buttons:
--use it - means the code will perform pushes and pops whenever neccecary.
**the SP value will be the same at the end of the code as it was at the begining
--use the commands - means the stack is not valid, no pushes or pops will be done
, but however some comands that affect the SP will be used.
**No guarantees for the SP value.
--don't touch the stack - the code will not change SP nor use any pushes or pops

Explanation for the memory locations.
IMPORTANT:Use only numbers as valid locations in the address space 0-65535.
The code will only ubenefit of up to 7-8 memory addresses, no need to put any more.

the value on this memory addresses will probably change in the generated code.

MAX VALUE:
states=~9 * 10^20
meaning with 200 ns for state
hours=~5 * 10^11
however please stick to some smaller values.

The messeges box will give you information about the procces of generating and errors it enocunters in you input.
